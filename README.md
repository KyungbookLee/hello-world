repository: oranize a single project and contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets 

branch: the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch.
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

commit: saved changes are called commits
Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

pull request: Update commit into other branch
you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
